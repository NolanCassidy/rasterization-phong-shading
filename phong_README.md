**Rasterization Phong Shading**

Combined rasterization and phong shading to display ambient and diffuse lighting
over a fluid simulation.

The video is made by stitching together 1000 images from different angles.

**Screenshots**

**Tech/framework used**

>   **Built with**

-   C++

-   VTK

**Features**

-   Phong shading

-   Ambient lighting

-   Diffuse lighting

-   Rasterization

-   Camera angles

-   Calculations made for each pixel

**Important Files**

Project1F.cxx – This is the final version of the code. It creates the full image
and includes all techniques throughout combined.

**Installation**

First cd into the folder

Edit cmake.txt file and replace any line containing ‘project1X.cxx’ with the
specific .cxx file you wish to run

Then compile the program by running the command ‘ccmake .’

**How to use?**

Now everything should be installed from the cmake file and you can run the
‘make’ command to run the program

Most programs will output images that have included phong shading, ambient
lighting, and diffuse lighting.
